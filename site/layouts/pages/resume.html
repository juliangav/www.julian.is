        <p>A seasoned product design & experimentation leader with an 11-year background in improving KPIs and crafting experiences guided by data and experimentation. Success lies in the pragmatic and user-centric approach to product features, scalable design systems, and experimentation frameworks driven by business objectives and northstar metrics. Throughout my career, I’ve also had the opportunity to build and manage multiple cross-functional design and experimentation teams from the ground up while simultaneously serving as an individual contributor.</p>
