Hello there,

As a product design leader with 11 years of experience, I am excited to apply for the Director of Product Design & Research role and would formally like to express my interest in joining Algolia. 

I joined the platform team at Thomasnet.com, the largest industrial sourcing platform in North America, in July of 2017 to lead the product design team and spearhead the platform's redesign. Since then, I grew the two-person design team to six and transformed and scaled the organization's approach to both product and design. As part of these efforts, I established a design-led experimentation program where we grew the platform's monthly active users from 760k to 1.7 million.

At the beginning of the pandemic, I proposed and created a COVID-19 Response System that helped connect manufacturers of PPE with front-line organizations. U.S. Congress then recommended this system to the Manufacturing Caucus as one of the top resources for PPE â€” second to FEMA.

In December of 2021, Thomasnet.com was acquired by Xometry, and I was transitioned to Senior Director of Product Design under the Xometry Product Design team. However, my passion is scaling, leading, and mentoring design teams. I finished my responsibilities in June and voluntarily parted ways in excellent standing to focus on myself and my next career move. Since then, I've dedicated my time to telling my story through case studies on my site and honing my presentation skills.

I'm confident that my passion and proven success as a product design leader will enable me to transform and scale design at Algolia as the Director of Product Design & Research. 

Thank you for your time. I look forward to talking to you more! 

Best,
Julian Gaviria
