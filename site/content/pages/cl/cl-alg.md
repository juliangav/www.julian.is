Hello there,

As a product design leader with 11 years of experience, I am excited to apply for the Director of Product Design & Research role and would formally like to express my interest in joining Algolia. 

I joined the platform team at Thomasnet.com, the largest industrial sourcing platform in North America, in July of 2017 to lead the product design team and spearhead the platform's redesign. Since then, I grew the two-person design team to six and transformed and scaled the organization's approach to both product and design. As part of these efforts, I established a design-led experimentation program where we grew the platform's monthly active users from 760k to 1.7 million.

At the beginning of the pandemic, I proposed and created a COVID-19 Response System that helped connect manufacturers of PPE with front-line organizations. U.S. Congress then recommended this system to the Manufacturing Caucus as one of the top resources for PPE â€” second to FEMA.

In December 2021, Thomasnet.com was acquired by Xometry who wanted a single product design for both platforms. As a result, I transitioned to an individual contributor role as Senior Director of Product Design. However, my passion is scaling, leading, and mentoring design teams. I finished my responsibilities in June and voluntarily parted ways in excellent standing to focus on myself and my next career move. 

Over the past month, I have carefully considered my options and resolved to only work as a design leader for a similarly high-profile platform. Algolia is one of the few that fit the bill, and I would relish the new challenge. Although the past month has helped me recharge my batteries, I am eager to get back into Figma & Slack and use my design leadership skills once again. 

Thank you for your time. I look forward to talking to you more! 

Best,
Julian Gaviria
