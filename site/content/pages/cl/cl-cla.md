Hello there,

As a product design leader with 11 years of experience and a UX engineering background, I am excited to apply for the Director of Product Design & UX role and would formally like to express my interest in joining Mindbody & ClassPass. 

I was most recently leading design for Thomasnet.com, North America's largest industrial sourcing platform. Since joining the product team as the Head of Design in July 2017, I have led the organization through a mobile-first platform redesign and transformed the approach to product design by establishing an experimentation and research-focused design culture based on user-centric design principles and quantitative results. 

As part of my design leadership efforts, I established a design-led experimentation program where we ran 300+ experiments to optimize the platform's experience resulting in the growth of our monthly active users from 760k to 1.7 million. 

At the beginning of the pandemic, I proposed and created a COVID-19 Response System that helped connect manufacturers of PPE with front-line organizations. U.S. Congress then recommended this system to the Manufacturing Caucus as one of the top resources for PPE â€” second to FEMA.

In December 2021, Thomasnet.com was acquired by Xometry, who wanted a single product design team for both platforms. As a result, I transitioned to an individual contributor role as Senior Director of Product Design. However, my passion is scaling, leading, and mentoring design teams. I finished my responsibilities in June and voluntarily parted ways in excellent standing to focus on myself and my next career move. 

Over the past month and a half, I have carefully considered my options and resolved to only work as a design leader for a high-profile multi-sided platform. Mindbody & ClassPass are one of the few that fit the bill, and I would relish the new challenge. 

Although my time off has helped me recharge my batteries, I am eager to get back into Figma, Slack, and Zoom and use my design leadership skills once again. 

Thank you for your time and I look forward to hearing from you! 

Best,
Julian Gaviria
