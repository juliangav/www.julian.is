<p>Hello! I’m a designer/developer based out of Jersey City, New Jersey. I have a huge passion for web design, front-end web development, and how it all comes together with good&nbsp;ol’&nbsp;UX. </p>

<h2 class="text-aligncenter">What I’m capable of doing</h2>

<h3 class="text-aligncenter">Web design that works</h3>

<p>Not only can I paint a pretty picture, but I can make that pretty picture generate business. Whether It’s lead generation or ecommerce sales, I create designs tailored specifically for the business goals at hand.</p>

<h3 class="text-aligncenter">Front-end web development that's pretty fast</h3>

<p>Yup, I code all of my designs myself. My websites are as beautiful in the inside as they are on the outside. Want to see what’s under the hood? Go ahead and <a href="https://www.webpagetest.org/video/" target="_blank">test my website</a> vs any other and see for yourself. </p>

<h3 class="text-aligncenter">Agile Process</h3>

<p>I work to get something out the door for you within the first 2 months of our friendship. But the buck doesn’t stop there, I then begin to test and iterate. Just because it worked for one client doesn’t mean it’ll work for you. That’s the beauty about the scientific approach to web design, test everything and leave subjectivity aside.</p>



<h2 class="text-aligncenter">What I’m currently doing</h2>

<p>At the moment I spend my days running a design and development team for <a href="http://rpm.thomasnet.com" target="_blank">RPM</a> in New York City. Say <a href="https://twitter.com/juliangav" target="_blank">hello</a> to me when you get a sec. :) </p>
