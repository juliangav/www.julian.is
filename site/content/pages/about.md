So you wanna know more? Sure. I’m a product designer & UX engineer — designer/developer in the simple days — who enjoys creating functional and aesthetically beautiful experiences. I also enjoy writing about what I do.

### How I got into design and code

I've been building for the web since my amazing mother bought me my first computer at the age of 12. I became fascinated by typing code and seeing things change on a screen. Borderline magical.

I ended up going to college on a soccer scholarship. Since I already knew the coding part of building websites, I decided to pursue a degree in graphic design instead of computer science. One of the most rewarding decisions I've made in my life. 

### Professional career

I graduated college in May 2011 and started my professional career in June as an entry-level web designer for a company called Thomasnet.com. I didn’t know it at the time, but here’s where I would build the foundation for my career.

A decade later, I'm now the VP of Product & Design for the organization's main product, the Thomasnet.com platform. The [journey between those two titles](/resume?src=about) has been an amazing and rewarding one.

### What I really enjoy doing

I enjoy designing and building things that solve problems that matter — I find it even more rewarding to lead teams that do the same. Measuring the effectiveness of what I’ve designed and built is also high up on the list. 

I’m one of the lucky few people that have found a career doing what they love.
