Why not? I spend most of my days trying to figure out design; whether I'm working with a junior designer trying to teach him/her a certain web design concept or I'm figuring out a stubborn front-end development bug, documentation on what I come across on a daily basis could be of good use to other designers in my field of work.


<h2>What to expect</h2>

There are three areas of web design in which I mostly focus on:

<h3>UI Design</h3>

Having designed over 100 websites over the past 6 years and lead a team of 4 designers over the past 3 years, this is an area where my experience stands out. Websites being beautiful is just as important as being functional. 

<h3>Front-End Web Development</h3>

I've been coding website's together since the age of 14; I love this. Being able to put my design brush aside and put on my analytical hat on is one of the parts that I love most about my field. I'm able to bridge that ambiguous gap between design and development from the perspective of both.

<h3>UX Design &amp; Testing</h3>

Over the past year, I've spearheaded a sub-division of my agency that's focused data driven website design and continuous improvement. I've been doing crazy, non-stop, A/B testing of all of my design patterns over a wide range of clients. Needless to say, some of the results I've come across have been pretty eye opening in terms of what the status quo is.

<h3>Design &amp; Development Team Management</h3>

I run a team of 4 designers and 4 developers for an agency in New York City; one which I've put together from scratch. The rollercoaster has been breath taking, but the experience has been priceless. I'll be touching on topics such as hiring, time management, process, &amp; creativity among many others.  

<h2>Giving back</h2>

Since early college I remember coming across website's like <a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Smashing Magazine</a> &amp; <a href="http://alistapart.com">A List Apart</a> and to those blogs, among the dozens of others, I give thanks; thanks for my career and the career of thousands of other designers & developers. It's because of generous designers like <a href="http://www.zeldman.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jeffrey Zeldman</a> &amp; <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/author/vitaly-friedman/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vitaly Friedman</a> that we are where we are today. I am now returning the favor to the design community.
