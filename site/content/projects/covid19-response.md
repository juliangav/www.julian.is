In the beginning of the pandemic, we created an emergency response system on Thomasnet.com that connected manufacturers of PPE-related products with front-line organizations. A system impactful enough to have Congress recommend Thomasnet.com as a critical resource to the Manufacturing Caucus — second to FEMA.

### The Problem

Manufacturing plants were shutting down in large numbers due to shifts in demand, the spread of COVID-19 within their workforce, and in some situations, regulations. This had the potential of was leaving buyers on Thomasnet.com reaching out to suppliers that were no longer in service.

### The Objective

To improve the existing Thomasnet.com experience with features time-sensitive to the critical supplies shortage and long-term scalable solutions focused on helping buyers efficiently find suppliers actively providing the respective products and services.
