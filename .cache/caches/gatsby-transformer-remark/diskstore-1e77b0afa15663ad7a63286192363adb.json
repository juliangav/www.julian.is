The faster we see a website load, whether it’s completely loaded or not, the faster we get entertained and the likelihood of sticking around on the website increases. CSS goes against this concept; it will not paint a website until the entire CSS file has loaded. Not to mention that CSS is also render-blocking, that’s right, no other assets on the web page will load if CSS hasn’t finished loading. The reason this isn’t as big of a deal as Javascript being render blocking is because CSS files are usually lightweight and don’t take up much processing power. However, websites are now becoming very CSS heavy and we’re starting to see the implications in the start-render time (the time it takes for a website to go from a blank screen to showing anything).","position":{"start":{"line":103,"column":1,"offset":9781},"end":{"line":103,"column":799,"offset":10579}}}],"position":{"start":{"line":103,"column":1,"offset":9781},"end":{"line":103,"column":799,"offset":10579}}},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"The fix?
